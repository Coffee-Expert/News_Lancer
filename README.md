## How It Works

### Real-Time Updates with NewsAPI

**News Lancer** leverages the powerful **NewsAPI** to fetch the latest news articles from trusted sources. The app constantly refreshes the news feed with every scroll, ensuring you receive the most recent headlines as you navigate through the app. This continuous refresh mechanism is designed to keep you updated in real-time without any manual effort.

### Features Explanation

- **Pleasant UI:** The app's design prioritizes user experience, offering a clean and intuitive interface that makes news browsing enjoyable.
- **Scrollable Feed:** The feed works seamlessly like the Inshorts app, allowing users to scroll through news articles easily. Each scroll triggers a fresh set of headlines, keeping the content up-to-date.
- **Trusted Sources:** News Lancer aggregates articles from over 10 globally trusted news outlets, ensuring the information you receive is reliable and credible.
- **Real-Time Updates:** With every scroll, NewsAPI is queried to fetch the latest news, providing you with up-to-the-minute information on various topics.
